# entropy for EEG measures
analyzing the effects of entropy values on the visual response measured from EEG

A cellur grid space is created with different colored tiles. The coloring are indicative of states being sampled from different parameterizations with different state space sizes (different macro states) so the entropy is different. Those images can be generated and the goal is to see if this will induce a different psychological response which can be measured.
